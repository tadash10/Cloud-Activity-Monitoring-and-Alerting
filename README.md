Cloud Activity Monitoring and Alerting Script

This Bash script is designed to monitor cloud activity logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor) in real-time. It can detect suspicious activities and send alerts, and it includes features such as configuration management, error handling, logging improvements, monitoring, notifications, escalation, and graceful shutdown.
Installation

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-activity-monitoring.git
cd cloud-activity-monitoring

Create a Configuration File:

    Create a config.json file in the script directory with the following structure:

    json

    {
        "CLOUD_PROVIDER": "AWS",
        "LOG_SOURCE": "CloudTrail",
        "ALERT_THRESHOLD": 5,
        "LOG_INTERVAL_SECONDS": 60,
        "ADMIN_EMAIL": "admin@example.com",
        "LOG_FILE": "/var/log/cloud_monitor.log",
        "METRICS_INTERVAL_SECONDS": 300
    }

    Customize the values according to your configuration. Ensure that the LOG_FILE and other paths are accessible by the script.

Start the Script:

    To start the monitoring script, use the following command:

    bash

    ./monitor.sh start

Stop the Script:

    To stop the script gracefully, use the following command:

    bash

        ./monitor.sh stop

Usage

    The script can be started with the start argument to begin monitoring cloud activity logs in the background. It will log information and send alerts based on your configuration.
    To stop the script gracefully, use the stop argument.

Monitoring and Metrics

This script includes a basic monitoring and metrics collection feature. You can extend it by integrating with monitoring tools like Prometheus or StatsD to track performance metrics such as memory usage and execution time.
Notifications and Escalation

The script provides notifications and escalation capabilities for alerting. It includes functions to send alerts to designated personnel and to escalate alerts if critical issues remain unresolved for a specified duration.
Graceful Shutdown

A graceful shutdown mechanism is implemented to allow the script to stop without data loss or corruption. It registers a trap to capture SIGTERM and SIGINT signals and performs cleanup actions before exiting.
